        <p>Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. It is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go. </p>
        <p>There are two major implementations: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Google's self-hosting "gc" compiler toolchain, targeting multiple operating systems and WebAssembly.</li>
          <li>gofrontend, a frontend to other compilers, with the libgo library. With GCC the combination is gccgo; with LLVM the combination is gollvm.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A third-party source-to-source compiler, GopherJS, compiles Go to JavaScript for front-end web development. </p>

          <p>History</p>
        </header>
        <p>Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases.[21] The designers wanted to address criticism of other languages in use at Google, but keep their useful characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Static typing and run-time efficiency (like C)</li>
          <li>Readability and usability (like Python)</li>
          <li>High-performance networking and multiprocessing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Go is influenced by C, but with an emphasis on greater simplicity and safety.</p>
        <p> Go's syntax includes changes from C aimed at keeping code concise and readable</p>
        <p>Go has a number of built-in types, including numeric ones (byte, int64, float32, etc.), booleans, and byte strings (string). Strings are immutable; built-in operators and keywords (rather than functions) provide concatenation, comparison, and UTF-8 encoding/decoding. Record types can be defined with the struct keyword. </p>

          <p>Hello world</p>
        </header>
        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
        <code>package main
          
          import "fmt"
          
          func main() {
              fmt.Println("hello world")
          }
        </code>
        <p>To run the program, put the code in hello-world.go and use go run.</p>
        <code>$ go run hello-world.go</code>

          <p>Omissions</p>
        </header>
        <p>Go deliberately omits certain features common in other languages, including (implementation) inheritance, assertions, pointer arithmetic, implicit type conversions, untagged unions, and tagged unions. The designers added only those facilities that all three agreed on. </p>
        <p>Of the omitted language features, the designers explicitly argue against assertions and pointer arithmetic, while defending the choice to omit type inheritance as giving a more useful language, encouraging instead the use of interfaces to achieve dynamic dispatch and composition to reuse code. Composition and delegation are in fact largely automated by struct embedding; according to researchers Schmager et al., this feature "has many of the drawbacks of inheritance: it affects the public interface of objects, it is not fine-grained (i.e, no method-level control over embedding), methods of embedded objects cannot be hidden, and it is static", making it "not obvious" whether programmers will overuse it to the extent that programmers in other languages are reputed to overuse inheritance. </p>
        <p>Exception handling was initially omitted in Go due to lack of a "design that gives value proportionate to the complexity". An exception-like panic/recover mechanism that avoids the usual try-catch control structure was proposed and released in the March 30, 2010 snapshot. The Go authors advise using it for unrecoverable errors such as those that should halt an entire program or server request, or as a shortcut to propagate errors up the stack within a package. Across package boundaries, Go includes a canonical error type, and multi-value returns using this type are the standard idiom. </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="style">
        <header>
          <p>Style</p>
        </header>
        <p>The Go authors put substantial effort into influencing the style of Go programs: </p>
        
        <p>Indentation, spacing, and other surface-level details of code are automatically standardized by the gofmt tool. It uses tabs for indentation and blanks for alignment. Alignment assumes that an editor is using a fixed-width font. golint does additional style checks automatically, but has been deprecated and archived by the Go maintainers.</p>
        <p>A combined declaration/initialization operator was introduced that allows the programmer to write: </p>
        <code>i := 3</code>
        <code>s := "Hello, world!"</code>
        <p>This contrasts with C's</p>
        <code>int i = 3;</code>
        <code>const char *s = "Hello, world!";</code>
